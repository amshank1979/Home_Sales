# Home_Sales

This notebook was imported directly from CoLab.  I had assistance from my tutor, AskBCS and my instructor.

In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.
